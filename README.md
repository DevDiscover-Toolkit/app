<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Developer Resource Rankings. Developers are able to submit resources to a common website to view, with their own reviews provided for the resource / link so that other developers are able to address their needs more easily. While Google might already be able to take care of this, knowing what to look for is a huge part of the task. Having a readily accessible website with peers, peer reviews, and filters that can help contextualize the tutorials / information you find with your career path can help improve an individualâ€™s growth as they continue self-learning.
